This script is for implemental fastqc in bacth in R
You need to pre-install the fastqc software on your computer

package vignette: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/fastqcr-an-r-package-facilitating-quality-controls-of-sequencing-data-for-large-numbers-of-samples

Install the package
```{r}
library(fastqcr)
```

```{r}
#sequencing lane 1
fastqc(fq.dir = "/Volumes/FantomHD/Lev_Kaz_bulk_RNA/FC01", # FASTQ files directory
       qc.dir = "/Users/weihan/Desktop/Research/Misc/Becker_Lab_RNA_seq/bulk_RNA/data/fastqc", # path to where you would like the output directory to be
       threads = 4,
       fastqc.path = "/Users/weihan/Documents/FastQC/fastqc") #path to the location where you installed the fastqc software
#sequencing lane 2
fastqc(fq.dir = "/Volumes/FantomHD/Lev_Kaz_bulk_RNA/FC02", # FASTQ files directory
       qc.dir = "/Users/weihan/Desktop/Research/Misc/Becker_Lab_RNA_seq/bulk_RNA/data/fastqc", # Results direcory
       threads = 4,
       fastqc.path = "/Users/weihan/Documents/FastQC/fastqc")
```


Aggregate and report result in a table
```{r}
qc <- qc_aggregate("/Users/weihan/Desktop/Research/Misc/Becker_Lab_RNA_seq/bulk_RNA/data/fastqc")
summary(qc)
```
